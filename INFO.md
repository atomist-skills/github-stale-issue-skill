Help keep your project's backlog clean by managing stale issues and pull
requests. This skill takes away the time-consuming task to go through open
issues and ask for more information or close issues that got abandoned by their
authors.

A GitHub issue and/or pull request that doesn't see any activity within a
configurable amount of days gets marked with a certain label to indicate that it
has become stale. Optionally this skill adds a comment to the issue or pull
request to inform contributors about the pending closing due to lack of
activity. Once the issue or pull request sees no additional activity within a
configurable amount of days after it has been marked stale, it will be closed.

When an issue or pull request that is marked stale gets modified, the stale
label will automatically be removed.
